mdwrap(1) -- wraps piped text for Markdown output
=================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`mdwrap`

## DESCRIPTION

Pipe text into the mdwrap(1) command to have it wrapped in Markdown's \`\`\` fence.

Output is then perfect for putting into GitHub Markdown snippets, or Slack.

Even better, pair it with pbcopy(1) to take it straight to the clipboard!
