nuname(1) -- normalised operating system name
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nuname`

## DESCRIPTION

The nuname(1) command prints out a normalised operating system name.

On all systems, it outputs a lowercase, single-word operating system name. This is intended to work around the fact that Cygwin outputs kernel information with uname output, while other operating systems do not.
